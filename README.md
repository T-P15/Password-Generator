# Password-Generator

A web based password generator

## Description

This Project was created with the motivation of providing people with a password generator that contains toggle options for content. The project contains a password generator that is randomised allowing for heightened security for users wishing to create new and unique passwords. Within this project I learnt about the functionality of javascript in coordination with HTML and CSS. Specifically form submission and media querys. Moreover, how to use variables to store data within javascript and pull specific values of these variables when required in functions.
